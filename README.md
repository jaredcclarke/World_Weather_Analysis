# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help the *PlanMyTrip App* add the weather description to the previously retrived weather data from cities. These cities were generated from code that prodruced random latitudes and longitudes. Input statements were created to filter the data to determine weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. This would allow the beta tester to select four cities and create a travel itinerary. With those selected cities, a travel route between the four cities and a marker layer map was created with the use of Google Maps Directions API.
